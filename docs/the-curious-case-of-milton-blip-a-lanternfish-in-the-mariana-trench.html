<p>Deep in the Mariana Trench, where the sun has long since given up, there lived a small, unassuming lanternfish named Milton Blip. Unlike his neighbors, who were content with floating about in eerie darkness, Milton had a dream‚Äîto become the world‚Äôs first deep-sea influencer.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPeople love glowing things,‚Äù he reasoned. ‚ÄúAnd I am a glowing thing.‚Äù</p>
<p>So Milton set about meticulously curating his brand. He adjusted the luminescence of his bioluminescent lure, ensuring it was neither too blue nor too green, because he had read somewhere (probably from a passing whale) that ‚Äúengagement is all about aesthetic.‚Äù He even attempted to take selfies by reflecting his own light against jellyfish, which, to his dismay, kept stinging him.</p>
<p>Despite the logistical hurdles (limited WiFi, a target audience that consisted mostly of blind shrimp), Milton remained dedicated to his craft. He continued posing dramatically in the deep-sea gloom, waiting for the day when someone‚Äîanyone‚Äîwould acknowledge that he was, in fact, glowing in a completely marketable way.</p>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs generate an image of Milton Blip, the aspiring deep-sea influencer.</p>
