<p>Puddles the Clownfish was, by all known laws of marine biology, not supposed to exist in an Idaho pond. And yet, there he was.</p>
<p>How exactly a tropical clownfish had ended up in a small, chilly body of water outside Sandpoint, Idaho, was a mystery only slightly less confusing than his unexpected comedic prowess. Despite his obvious disadvantage (namely, that no other fish in the pond understood what a ‚Äúreef‚Äù or an ‚Äúanemone‚Äù was), Puddles had somehow become the pond‚Äôs most beloved stand-up comedian.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou ever notice how goldfish have the memory of a particularly dim-witted rock?‚Äù he would say, before turning dramatically to a goldfish in the crowd. ‚ÄúSteve, you‚Äôre looking confused. I just told this joke five seconds ago.‚Äù</p>
<p>His performances were legendary, drawing fish from across the pond and even a few bemused frogs who weren‚Äôt quite sure what was happening but enjoyed the energy. His catchphrase‚Äî‚ÄúThank you, I‚Äôll be here all winter! Because I literally can‚Äôt leave!‚Äù‚Äîalways brought the house down (or would have, if ponds had houses).</p>
