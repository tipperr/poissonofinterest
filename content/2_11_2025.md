Summary: Puddles the Clownfish was not supposed to be in an Idaho pond. Neither was he supposed to be the most celebrated stand-up comedian in local fish history. And yet, here he is. Goldfish Steve keeps forgetting the punchlines. Come for the fish jokes. Stay because Puddles literally can’t leave. 😂🐟🔗

Puddles the Clownfish was, by all known laws of marine biology, not supposed to exist in an Idaho pond. And yet, there he was.

How exactly a tropical clownfish had ended up in a small, chilly body of water outside Sandpoint, Idaho, was a mystery only slightly less confusing than his unexpected comedic prowess. Despite his obvious disadvantage (namely, that no other fish in the pond understood what a “reef” or an “anemone” was), Puddles had somehow become the pond’s most beloved stand-up comedian.

“You ever notice how goldfish have the memory of a particularly dim-witted rock?” he would say, before turning dramatically to a goldfish in the crowd. “Steve, you’re looking confused. I just told this joke five seconds ago.”

His performances were legendary, drawing fish from across the pond and even a few bemused frogs who weren’t quite sure what was happening but enjoyed the energy. His catchphrase—“Thank you, I’ll be here all winter! Because I literally can’t leave!”—always brought the house down (or would have, if ponds had houses).
