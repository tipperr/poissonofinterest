Summary: 🎤 “Thank you, I’ll be here all winter! Because I literally can’t leave.” — Puddles the Clownfish has somehow ended up in an Idaho pond, where he’s the greatest stand-up comedian fish have ever seen. (Goldfish Steve keeps forgetting the jokes.) 🐟😂

Puddles the Clownfish was, by all known laws of marine biology, not supposed to exist in an Idaho pond. And yet, there he was.

How exactly a tropical clownfish had ended up in a small, chilly body of water outside Sandpoint, Idaho, was a mystery only slightly less confusing than his unexpected comedic prowess. Despite his obvious disadvantage (namely, that no other fish in the pond understood what a “reef” or an “anemone” was), Puddles had somehow become the pond’s most beloved stand-up comedian.

“You ever notice how goldfish have the memory of a particularly dim-witted rock?” he would say, before turning dramatically to a goldfish in the crowd. “Steve, you’re looking confused. I just told this joke five seconds ago.”

His performances were legendary, drawing fish from across the pond and even a few bemused frogs who weren’t quite sure what was happening but enjoyed the energy. His catchphrase—“Thank you, I’ll be here all winter! Because I literally can’t leave!”—always brought the house down (or would have, if ponds had houses).
