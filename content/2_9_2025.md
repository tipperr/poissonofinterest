Summary: Harold Bloopington III, a bluefin tuna of exquisite girth and existential despair, has spent his life pondering the unbearable meaninglessness of it all—a condition made slightly worse by the fact that jellyfish are terrible conversationalists. Dive in. Or don’t. He’s still thinking about it. 🐟🤔🔗

It was an ordinary Tuesday morning in the North Atlantic, which is to say, rather damp and largely indifferent to the concerns of anyone within it. Harold Bloopington III, a bluefin tuna of great girth and greater ennui, was contemplating, as he often did, the unbearable pointlessness of existence.

While most bluefin tuna occupied themselves with the exhilarating pastime of Not Being Eaten, Harold had taken a different approach to life—namely, he had decided to dedicate his time to philosophy. He spent his days drifting lazily, engaging in deep discussions with passing jellyfish who, as it turned out, had very little to say on the matter beyond blorp.

Harold had once published a widely ignored treatise titled The Epistemology of Flotsam: Thoughts on the Nature of Being While Avoiding Nets, which, due to a tragic misprint, ended up as The Epistemology of Flotsam: Thoughts on the Nature of Beans While Avoiding Nets and subsequently became a bestselling cookbook in Norway. Harold had never recovered from the humiliation.

Most of the ocean had learned to ignore Harold’s ruminations, but occasionally, a passing pod of dolphins would humor him with a conversation before realizing they had wandered into yet another one of his “but what is the sound of water?” debates and quickly remembered urgent appointments elsewhere.

Ultimately, Harold continued floating through life, pondering its meaning and, more importantly, whether he was swimming towards a grander purpose or simply in a slightly different direction than yesterday.
