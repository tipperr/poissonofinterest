Col. Chester de los Reyes Ticklesticks XVI PhD, Esq. (known to his friends as “Tickles”) was a sockeye salmon with a flair for the dramatic and an unfortunate tendency to monologue mid-swim. His journey up the Yukon River each year was not just a migration—it was a performance.

With a booming voice that echoed beautifully through the water (much to the dismay of those who preferred quiet swimming), Tickles had gained a reputation as the premier underwater Shakespearean actor of his generation. His one-fish rendition of Hamlet was legendary, featuring a particularly moving performance of “To spawn or not to spawn” that left even the most hardened trout in tears.

Unfortunately, his tendency to deliver long-winded soliloquies at inopportune times had led to more than one close encounter with a grizzly bear. One particularly harrowing season, he survived only because the bear, too, became captivated by Tickles’ rendition of Macbeth.

Though many found his over-the-top delivery exhausting, there was no denying his talent. Indeed, it was said that his final leap up a waterfall was less an athletic feat and more a grand theatrical exit, complete with an invisible spotlight and a dramatic musical cue played, one assumes, by very confused otters.
